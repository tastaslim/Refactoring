# How to refactor #
- Make sure after refactoring your code should be cleaner than previous on and still all features are working. If code is not cleaner, you have just wasted your time.
- Make sure you have a good understanding of the code you are refactoring.
- Make sure while refactoring, no new functionality should be added in your code. Refactoring and adding new feature are two different things. Once you complete refactoring, then you can add new features.
- Make sure all previous test cases are passing after refactoring.
