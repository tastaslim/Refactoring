# When to refactor #
**Follow rules of 3 for this.**
1. When you are writing code for the 1st time, just get it done.
2. When you are doing something similar for the second time, keep refactoring thought in mind but anyways get it done.
3. when you are doing something similar for the third time, start refactoring it.

## Adding new feature ##
While adding new feature into someone else dirty code, first refactor it and then add new features. It is very easy to understand clean code and add new features into it because it will be very easy for other people to understand and use it.

## When fixing bugs ##
Clean your code, you will automatically fine bugs.

## During code review ##
This is last and probably the most important part of the refactoring process because after this your code will be going to production. It is always best to do code review in pairs, make sure author is present.
